v1.0.0 (2016-06-14)
-------------------

These notes describe changes since the previous v0.3.0 version from
April 3 2013.

The new v1.0.0 version contains both many upstream fixes and
improvements from Git and a lot of specific user contributed features.

We think that Sharness is used and supported by enough projects and
developers, and stable enough, now to be ready for a v1.0.0 version.

Externally visible features:

* Add a 'cleanup' api to register cleanup actions, thanks to Dennis
  Kaarsemaker.
* Add simple test_seq(), thanks to Christian Couder.
* Add test_pause() from Git, thanks to Christian Couder.
* Add test_must_be_empty(), thanks to Konstantin Koroviev.
* Add SHARNESS_TEST_SRCDIR to run tests from a different directory,
  thanks to Mark A. Grondona.
* Implement --long-tests to run EXPENSIVE tests, thanks to Matthieu
  Moy.
* Support extensions in a sharness.d directory, thanks to Mark
  A. Grondona.
* Interactive tests, thanks to Dennis Kaarsemaker.

Internal improvements and bug fixes:

* Add a linter that detects broken && chains, thanks to Dennis
  Kaarsemaker.
* Export SHELL_PATH, thanks to Christian Couder.
* Fix color support when tput needs ~/.terminfo, thanks to Richard
  Hansen.
* Fix pathname of test-results/*.counts file, thanks to Richard
  Hansen.
* Sort test scripts before running them, thanks to Richard Hansen.
* Use SHARNESS_TRASH_DIRECTORY to enter the trash directory and drop
  the test_dir internal variable, thanks to Alexander Sulfrian.
* A lot of new TTY and sub sharness related tests, thanks to Mark
  A. Grondona.
* Build on Travis-CI using a container based build infrastructure,
  thanks to Mark A. Grondona.

Documentation improvements:

* Mention the Sharness Cookbook in the README, thanks to Mathias
  Lafeldt.
* Add alternatives to Sharness like Cram, rnt and ts to the README,
  thanks to Roman Neuhauser and Simon Chiang.
* Consistent Markdown headings, thanks to Mathias Lafeldt.
* Replace Contact with Author section, thanks to Mathias Lafeldt.
* New CONTRIBUTING.md document, thanks to Christian Couder.
* Mention Sharnessify a new installation tool, thanks to
  Christian Couder.
* Usage clarifications, thanks to Matthieu Moy.
* Improved flag descriptions in the README, thanks to Matthieu Moy.

Maintainer and project changes:

* Mathias Lafeldt, who created Sharness by extracting it from the
  Git codebase in April 2011, decided to step down and pass on the
  maintainership to Christian Couder. Thanks a lot, Mathias, for
  creating Sharness and maintaining it during all these years!

* Following the above point, Mathias transferred the Sharness
  GitHub repository to Christian, so the project can now be found on:
  https://github.com/chriscool/sharness and its web page is now:
  http://chriscool.github.io/sharness/
